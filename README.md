## Cleaned version of [tabler-react](#https://tabler.github.io/tabler-react)

- As per your example, it is difficult to fetch Form Element values.
- So I have created a simplified & standalone Registration Page. With this its much easy to handle form actions & values.
- Please refer to [/src/pages/RegisterPage.react.js](#https://github.com/sparkleptic/m1/blob/master/src/pages/RegisterPage.react.js) for more details
